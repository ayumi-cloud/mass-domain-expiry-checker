# mass-domain-expiry-tool

If you're the type of person who needs to keep an eye on a lot of domain expiries, then this might
just be the tool for you!

This script simply requests whois information for all the domains you've entered into `domains.txt`
and tries to extract the expiry information and pretty prints the results.

## Install

    npm install

## Run

    npm start

## More TLD support

This tool assumes that whois query results are consistent between all queries to a given TLD
(registrar).

To add support for more TLDs, simply add the corresponding regex' and MomentJS format string into
`tlds.js`.
